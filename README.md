<h1 align="center">HEEEY YOOOU GUUUYS</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://pengols.github.io/HeeeyYooouGuuuys/index.html)

This is the website for my third Code Institute project focusing Python and MongoDB.  The site is designed to be responsive and contains an IT Helpdesk ticketing system. Users will be able to create, edit, read and delete Helpdesk tickets. It is styled to provide end users with ease of readability.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to play a game that tests my memory.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to reminisce about the 80's.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to see if I can better my previous score.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find social links to the creator.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added difficulty levels.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new images, music or graphics.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   A number of 80's style colours are used to evoke a nostalgic feeling. Primarily the site uses a neon pink #F117F1  and purple pallette #8519EA. There are accents of green #00FF66 for which the colour mimics old green screen monitors from the decade and yellow #FFFB00 that matches the collectable coins of a famous video game plumber.
    -   #### Typography
        -   There are two primary fonts for the website - Press Start P2 & VT323. Sans Serif is used as the fallback font, in case for any reason, the fonts aren't being imported into the site correctly. Both Press Start P2 and VT323 are evocative of the fonts used in video games throughout the decade.  I have used Press Start P2 for buttons and titles and VT323 for larger pieces of text as it is easier to read.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The background image is designed to be evocative of vector designs from the era. It has a nostalgic aesthetic and uses neon pink and purple from which the site takes design cues. The card images are chosen to reflect pop culture and technology from the decade.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to play a game that tests my memory.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the play page that contains the game. There is also an easily visible PLAY button in the intro text that will also lead the user to the game.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to reminisce about the 80's.

        1. The site is deliberately styled with a retro feel to invoke nostalgic feelings for the user.
        2. The game cards contain images from the decade which should invoke those same nostalgic feelings.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to see if I can better my previous score.

        1. The victory modal that shows on the completion of the game gives the player a rating out of three stars enabling them to know if their score can be bettered.
        2. Total moves and total time are also shown on the victory modal so the player can aim to improve time taken and moves made on subsequent attempts.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find social links to the creator.

        1. A link to the creators GitHub is visible in the footer on all pages.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added difficulty levels.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can see if any difficulty levels have been added on navigating to the game page.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new images, music or graphics.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and new changes would be immediately visible.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox browsers for desktop.
-   The website was tested on Google Chrome, Safari, Samsung Internet and Amazon Silk on mobile devices.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Windows Desktop, Windows Laptop, Samsung S8, Samsung S9, Samsung S3 tablet, Motorola G4, Amazon Fire, iPhone7, iPhone 8.
-   Frequent tests were undertaken after major code changes to ensure cross-browser and cross-device compatibility.
-   Friends and family members of ages ranging from 3 to 73, were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
-   Google Lighthouse devloper tool in Google Chrome dev tools was used to ensure pages meet best practice.

### Known Bugs & Resolutions if Applicable

-   iOS Safari - does not support .ogg media files.  Resolved by converting any affected audio files to .mp3.
-   iOS Safari - Apple has blocked the control of HTML5 audio using JavaScript.  Volume can only be controlled through hardware interaction by the user. [Apple Developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/Device-SpecificConsiderations/Device-SpecificConsiderations.html). No fix implemented at this point.
-   iOS Safari - Cards showing a blank front after flip animation.  Card front image was visible during the flip animation. Resolved by adding `background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.01);` to .card and .card.flipped CSS classes.
-   Google Chrome - Card flip animation not visible. Resolved by adding `-webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d;` and `-webkit-transform: rotateY(-180deg);` to .card, .card.flipped, and .card-back and .card-front classes.
-   Internet Explorer 11 - Flexbox and ES6 JavaScript issues.  Overlays are not interactive and card grid does not build correctly, instead a column of 16 cards is visible.  These issues remain unresolved.
